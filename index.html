      <p>Once upon a time, on the first day of school, there was a lonely freshman wandering the halls. No body knew who this freshman was, and frankly he didn't know anybody either, but regardless he remains determined to get his degree. Walking through the halls, he avoids eye contact, so as to not have to interact with anyone at any time. He was shy, and he felt lost in this suddenly new world he just entered. But then, someone approached him. They began to speak to him. Was this a friend? An enemy? He wasn't too sure. But he decided to say hello, and they told him:...</p>

      <p>"Hi I'm Jerome are you interested in banana splits?" The lonely freshman didn't know how to respond. He stood wide-eyed and still.

      <p>The freshman didn't know what to do with this information. He knew that he should probably try to start making friends, but didn't know if eating ice cream was the best way to do that.

At first it was scary, everything in him was telling him to stop eating the 'gateway' dessert, but there were just so many flavors! Strawberry, Chocolate, Vanilla, even one with all three called Neapolitan! After eating around 7 pints, his stomach began to grumble.</p>
