      <p>Once upon a time, on the first day of school, there was a lonely freshman wandering the halls. No body knew who this freshman was, and frankly he didn't know anybody either, but regardless he remains determined to get his degree. Walking through the halls, he avoids eye contact, so as to not have to interact with anyone at any time. He was shy, and he felt lost in this suddenly new world he just entered. But then, someone approached him. They began to speak to him. Was this a friend? An enemy? He wasn't too sure. But he decided to say hello, and they told him:...</p>

      <p>"Hi I'm Jerome are you interested in banana splits?" The lonely freshman didn't know how to respond. He stood wide-eyed and still. The student continued, "We're having weekly meetings for our banana split club starting tonight at 5:30." The student handed the freshman a flyer with the most beautiful banana split on it. "I'm actually lactose intolerant, do you have soy ice cream?", the freshman spurted out. "No, sorry this is a strictly dairy club."</p>

      <p>The freshman didn't know what to do with this information. He knew that he should probably try to start making friends, but didn't know if eating ice cream was the best way to do that. His mom had always told him to be careful around children who like ice cream. It was a 'gateway' dessert, and eating ice cream would lead to brownies and chocolate and the worst of all cake.</p>

      <p>The lonely freshman had heard a lot about cake, and what it can do to a waistline, but in the spur of the moment he went for it. He sat down with a group of people enjoying the ice cream. At first it was scary, everything in him was telling him to stop eating the 'gateway' dessert, but there were just so many flavors! Strawberry, Chocolate, Vanilla, even one with all three called Neapolitan! After eating around 7 pints, his stomach began to grumble and he started seeing spots!</p>

      <p>Next thing he knew, he was laying on the ground looking up at the ceiling. His lactose intolerance had bested him once again, and he had fainted! Of course, a crowd of people had gathered around. They were most certainly concerned citizens, but the freshman just felt like he was being gawked at. After a few minutes of floor time, when he felt ready to be back on his feet, he grabbed one of the many hands that had been offered to him. He stood up, immediately sat down at a nearby table, and was joined by the person who had helped him up.</p>
